Project Proposal (to be added to the repo Readme):
1. NOM.ify
2. This application helps you keep track of how much your meals cost. Food costs are rising, and it’s hard to keep track of how much each meal you make costs. 
3. Our application helps you keep up with the price of your meals.
4. List of features:
- Create account and login.
- Ability to add foods and their prices to the users “pantry”.
- Calculates food costs with minimal user input.
- View meal price history and price comparison. Possibly through email too.

Pick 5:
Server-side data persistence (e.g., with PostgreSQL, MongoDB, MySQL)
Front-end framework including Bootstrap, Backbone.js, AngularJS
Data / screen scraping
Reporting with charts and graphs
Send emails and/or SMSes (e.g., Twilio)
5. We will be collecting food price information. We will also keep track of: what foods a certain user has in their pantry, how much their past meals cost.	
6. We may need to develop some special techniques to deal with inconsistent user input (e.g. determining when different bar codes belong to the same foods). Depending on the direction our project goes, we may also need to figure out a way to predict serving sizes based on some basic information.
